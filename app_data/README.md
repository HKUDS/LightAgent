Due to the fact that the AndroidLab image does not support Android Studio on macOS, some app tasks must be configured manually. 

For Pi Music, we collected the corresponding music files according to the original task descriptions and manually added them to the app to meet the testing requirements as much as possible. For certain tasks, such as total song duration, we modified the evaluation criteria based on the actual music files collected (see `./evaluation/pimusic`).
